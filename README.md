# My Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio project built with React using Vite. The portfolio is fully responsive and features multiple sections such as Hero, Projects, Skills, and Contact. It also includes theme management using Context API for switching between light and dark modes.




## Features

- Hero Section: Contains my name, a brief description, and a button to download my CV. It also features an AI-generated cartoon realistic image.
- Projects Section: Showcases my projects, each linking to their respective GitHub repositories.
- Skills Section: Highlights my key skills in various technologies.
- Contact Section: Includes a simple contact form (backend will be implemented in the future).
- Footer: A clean and simple footer.


## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: Front-end tool for fast builds and development.
- Context API: Used for managing light and dark theme modes.
- HTML5 and CSS3: For structure and styling, ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
## Theme Management

The portfolio uses the Context API to toggle between light and dark themes. The selected theme is saved in localStorage, so it persists across sessions.
